title: 'Next step: Enable Zenodo integration'
---

By enabling Zenodo integration, your package will automatically get a DOI which can be used to cite your package. After enabling Zenodo integration for your GitHub repository, Zenodo will create a snapshot and archive each release you make on GitHub. Moreover, Zenodo will create a new DOI for each GitHub release of your code.

To enable Zenodo integration:

1. Go to http://zenodo.org and login with your GitHub account. When you are redirected to GitHub, *Authorize application* to give permission to Zenodo to access your account.
1. Go to <https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/> and enable Zenodo integration of your repository by clicking on `On` toggle button.
2. Your package will get a DOI only after you make a release. Create a new release as described in [README.dev.md]({{cookiecutter.repository_url}}/blob/main/README.dev.md#33-github)
3. At this point you should have a DOI. To find out the DOI generated by Zenodo:
   1. Visit https://zenodo.org/deposit and click on your repository link
   2. You will find the latest DOI in the right column in Versions box in **Cite all versions?** section
   3. Copy the text of the link. For example `10.5281/zenodo.1310751`
4. Update the badge in your repository
   1. Edit README.md and replace the badge placeholder with the badge link you copied in previous step.
   The badge placeholder is shown below.

      `[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/<replace-with-created-DOI>.svg)](https://doi.org/<replace-with-created-DOI>)`
