# Netherlands eScience Center Python Template

Spend less time setting up and configuring your new Python packages and comply with the
[Netherlands eScience Center Software Development Guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/)
from the start.

Use this [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) template to generate
an empty Python package. Features include:

- Boilerplate tests and documentation,
- [Python setup configuration]({{cookiecutter.project_name}}/setup.py),
- Open source software license,
- [Default Github actions]({{cookiecutter.project_name}}/.github/workflows) for building, testing and deployment
- Code style checking,
- [Editorconfig]({{cookiecutter.project_name}}/.editorconfig),
- Miscellaneous files, such as [Change log]({{cookiecutter.project_name}}/CHANGELOG.md), [Code of Conduct]({{cookiecutter.project_name}}/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and [Contributing guidelines]({{cookiecutter.project_name}}/CONTRIBUTING.md),
- A [README]({{cookiecutter.project_name}}/README.md) and [a separate document]({{cookiecutter.project_name}}/project_setup.md) with extensive documentation about project setup.
- Continuous code quality and code coverage reporting using [Sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io/)

## How to use

### Step 1/3: Install `cookiecutter`

We recommend installing `cookiecutter` in user space as per `cookiecutter`'s instructions. This way, you don't have to
install `cookiecutter` for every new project.

```shell
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade cookiecutter
```

### Step 2/3: Generate the files and directory structure

Run `cookiecutter` with the template:

```shell
# Notes:
#   1. See table below for explanation of each question
#   2. The files will be generated in a new directory
cookiecutter https://github.com/nlesc/python-template.git
```

| Name                      | Default value | Explanation |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| package_name              | my_python_package | Name of the package. Avoid using spaces, dashes, or uppercase letters for the best experience across operating systems. |
| project_name              | my_python_package | Name of the project that contains the package. Avoid using spaces or uppercase letters for the best experience across operating systems. |
| package_short_description | &nbsp;            | The information that you enter here will end up in the README, documentation, license, and setup.cfg, so it may be a good idea to prepare something in advance. |
| version                   | 0.1.0             | &nbsp; |
| github_organization       | &lt;my-github-organization&gt; | GitHub organization that will contain this project's repository. This can also be your GitHub user name. |
| license                   | Apache Software License 2.0 | The software license under which the code is made available.  |
| full_name                 | John Smith        | Your full name, e.g. _John Smith_. |
| email                     | yourname@esciencecenter.nl | Your (work) email address. |
| copyright_holder          | Netherlands eScience Center | Name(s) of the organization(s) or person(s) who hold the copyright of the software. |
| code_of_conduct_email     | yourname@esciencecenter.nl | Email address of the person who should be contacted in case of violations of the Code of Conduct. |

Once the project files have been generated, follow the steps outlined in
[{{cookiecutter.project_name}}/next_steps.md]({{cookiecutter.project_name}}/next_steps.md).

### Step 3/3: Read about what was just generated

Good job! You have now generated the skeleton for your package:

```text
my-python-project/

├── CITATION.cff
├── CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── docs
